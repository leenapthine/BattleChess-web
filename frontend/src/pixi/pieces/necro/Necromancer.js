// Description:
// This file defines the **Necromancer**, a special unit in the Battle Chess game.
//
// Overview:
// - The Necromancer is a Level 2 unit that inherits the diagonal movement of a Bishop.
// - It belongs to the **Necromancer Race**, a powerful faction of spellcasters and undead manipulators.
// - In addition to standard diagonal movement, the Necromancer possesses a **Raise Dead** ability.
//
// Special Ability â€“ Raise Dead:
// - Upon **capturing** an enemy piece, the Necromancer can raise a new **Pawn** from the dead.
// - After a successful capture, **adjacent empty squares** around the captured location will be highlighted.
// - The player can **click on any highlighted square** to place a resurrected Pawn of the Necromancer's color.
// - This ability only works immediately after the capture and only if at least one adjacent square is available.
//
// Usage:
// - This logic is integrated with the piece highlighter and click handler modules.
// - The piece is fully playable in the current system and behaves like a Bishop until a capture occurs.
